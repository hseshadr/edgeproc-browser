				// the nav-release race, and partial-write recovery are unproven
				// by this package. They are exercised downstream in edge-reco's
				// Playwright c1/offline tiers against a real browser.
				// FOLLOW-UP: this package needs its own real-browser tier
				// (vitest browser mode or Playwright) before opfsStore can carry
				// a coverage claim. Tracked in README "Known gaps".
