## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A portable SQLite application-state Lego.** The opt-in
  `@edgeproc/browser/sqlite` export provides namespaced byte rows, bounded
  listing, atomic batches with epoch CAS, transactional schema migrations,
  integrity checks, real SQLite byte export, staged validated import with
  transactional table replacement, reset, and runtime facts without exposing
  arbitrary SQL. It reuses the pinned SQLite 3.53.4 Worker runtime and its
  official `opfs-wl` VFS for Web-Lock-coordinated multi-tab access, while the
  existing vector adapter keeps its single-owner SAH pool. Real Chromium proves
  cross-Worker visibility, stale-CAS rejection, persistence,
  export/import, and zero external requests.

- **A shared browser-engine contract for multiple consumers.** Signed sync now
  supports exact nullable identity pins, whole-file and safe directory-prefix
  scopes (`[]` is catalog-only; `undefined` is all files), per-verified-chunk
  progress, progress-rearmed idle timeouts, typed Worker errors, and an explicit
  locked cache clear. Persistent storage uses OPFS as the sole content store
  with a tiny IndexedDB pointer floor, falls back to full IndexedDB when OPFS is
  unavailable, and can declaratively reuse a bounded legacy database/store/key
  layout. A real Vite fixture proves the supported consumer-owned Worker entry
  emits exactly one engine Worker. Direct browser ESM users can opt into
  `spawnEngineClient()` through the separate `@edgeproc/browser/spawn` subpath,
  keeping the root client export free of dependency-internal Worker URLs.

- **`PackedVectorIndex` for immutable signed-bundle matrices.** The
  dependency-free synchronous adapter copies and validates FLOAT32 input,
  computes exact cosine similarity with deterministic ties, exposes defensive
  row copies, and fails closed after zeroizing disposal.

- **Reproducible exact-Git-SHA installs across npm, pnpm, and Bun.**
  Deterministic `dist/` output is committed for clients that skip Git-package
  lifecycle scripts; `prepare` still rebuilds it where supported, and the gate
  rejects any source/artifact drift. Registry packages remain limited to
  `dist/`. Native Node ESM loading of every side-effect-free public export is a
  distribution contract, including explicit `.js` vector imports.

- **A replaceable browser vector contract and opt-in SQLite/OPFS adapter.** The
  dependency-free `FlatVectorIndex` and the Worker-hosted SQLite adapter share
  one conformance suite. The persistent adapter statically links only SQLite
  3.53.4 and Apache-2.0 sqlite-vector 1.1.2—no FAISS and no SQLiteAI
  sync/memory/network bundle—uses exact FLOAT32 cosine search, transactional
  batches, parameterized AND filters, deterministic ID tie breaks, and explicit
  disposal. Pinned artifact hashes, a digest-pinned Docker rebuild, and packaged
  third-party notices make the WASM auditable. A real Chromium test proves OPFS
  persistence across Worker restart and zero external requests.

- **A publish preflight that makes a stale `dist/` unpublishable.**
  `prepublishOnly` now runs `scripts/preflight-publish.mjs` and then the full
  gate. The script refuses outright — before anything is built or packed — if the
  tree is dirty, if `HEAD` is neither on a remote-tracking branch nor at an exact
  local tag published unchanged to `origin`, or if there is no git work tree at
  all; then it deletes `dist/` so the gate's build cannot reuse a stale object.
  This covers both normal branch builds and GitHub Actions' shallow detached-tag
  checkout without trusting a local-only or moved tag. `files: ["dist"]` means
  the tarball *is* `dist/`, which is
  gitignored, so previously `npm publish` shipped whatever the last build left on
  disk. It nearly shipped exactly that: `dist/engine/client.js` was rebuilt three
  minutes after `#releaseWorker()` landed and two days after the only commit on
  `main`, so the compiled output carried a fix no published commit contained.
  Covered by `test/publish-preflight.test.ts`, which drives every refusal and the
  accept case against real throwaway repos.

### Security

- **The anti-rollback floor now survives a key change.** `syncIndex` used to
  re-verify the durable active pointer under the currently pinned key and, on a
  `SignatureError`, clear it and treat the client as never having synced. Any
  key change — a planned rotation or a swapped pinned key — therefore reset the
  floor, and the next pointer, including an OLD release re-signed by the new
  key, was promoted with no freshness comparison. The stored pointer is now the
  floor whether or not the current key can verify it (it only ever refuses,
  never grants trust); serving the cached bundle offline still requires a
  signature valid under the current key, so an unverifiable cache fails closed
  instead of being served. This matches edge-proc's `cas.py`, which never
  re-verifies its stored pointer. No storage key or format change. Rotations
  must keep `sequence` increasing; a corrupted durable counter can only cause a
  `RollbackError`, recovered by an explicit cache clear.

### Fixed

- **Transient chunk outages no longer abort a cold sync immediately.** Only
  `NetworkError` receives six attempts with exponential jitter and a hard
  9-second backoff ceiling. Integrity, signature, storage, and rollback
  failures remain fail-closed with no retry.

- **CONTRIBUTING claimed things that were not true of this package.** It said
  coverage was enforced at 100% (`vitest.config.ts` enforces 90/90/90/85) because
  "the library is pure logic with no I/O" (its subject is OPFS, Workers and
  BroadcastChannel); it said the package has zero runtime dependencies (it has
  three); it told you to `cd errors` after cloning; and it listed the gate's steps
  in the wrong order, hiding that the build runs before the tests on purpose.

## Planned 0.1.0 (not yet published)

This is the planned first release; npm and GitHub do not yet carry a 0.1.0
package, tag, or release. The signed-bundle sync substrate of edge-proc was extracted from
[edge-reco](https://github.com/hseshadr/edge-reco) — where it had been running in
production — so its three consumers can stop each carrying their own copy after
publication.

### Added

- **Verification core** — `verifyEd25519`, `sha256Hex` (`SignatureError`);
  `canonicalBytes` for the exact bytes a signature is taken over;
  `decompressAndVerify` / `verifyPlaintext` with a bounded expansion limit
  (`IntegrityError`); `decompressBounded` over `@hpcc-js/wasm-zstd`.
- **Sync state machine** — `syncIndex` and `materializeFile`, with monotonic
  pointer enforcement (`RollbackError` on a lower or equal-sequence pointer,
  rejected *before* the manifest fetch) and structural caps (`SyncCapError`).
- **Transport** — `fetchBytes`, byte-capped while streaming and bounded by a 15s
  deadline that includes body consumption. An oversized response raises
  `ResponseTooLargeError`, which extends `IntegrityError` rather than
  `NetworkError`, so sync can never silently serve cache for one.
- **Stores** — `MemoryCacheStore` and `OpfsCacheStore`, both content-addressed
  and fail-closed on read as well as write.
- **Worker boundary** — `EngineClient` plus typed failures `WorkerCrashError` and
  `WorkerTimeoutError`. A Worker that dies during init never posts a reply; without
  these, every in-flight promise hangs forever.
- **`installNetworkSentinel`** — the module this package exists to share. Each
  browsing context keeps its own resource-timing timeline, so a window-side
  `PerformanceObserver` cannot see anything a Worker fetches. The sentinel observes
  a Worker's own timeline and broadcasts it on a same-origin `BroadcastChannel`,
  carrying EPOCH timestamps (the one clock every context shares) so a reader can
  rebase them. `isNetworkSentinelReport` validates shape before counting, because
  same-origin is not the same as trusted. It degrades to a no-op rather than
  throwing where `PerformanceObserver` or `BroadcastChannel` is missing.
- `test/dist-contract.test.ts`, which asserts against **real build output** that
  the opt-in `spawnEngineClient()` names a Worker file that exists, that the
  root client contains no Worker URL, that every `exports` path resolves, and
  that nothing shipped imports `node:*`.
- `test/workflow-security.test.ts`, which fails the gate on any unpinned `uses:`
  or top-level write scope, and carries accept/reject cases so the rule itself is
  proven rather than assumed.

### Changed from the extracted source

- Relative import specifiers gained `.js` extensions for spec-correct ESM.
- The consumer-independent persistence, scoped-sync, progress, typed-error,
  locked-clear, and packed-vector contracts now live here instead of remaining
  vendored in product repositories.
- Worker spawning moved out of `EngineClient` and into the opt-in
  `@edgeproc/browser/spawn` subpath. The supported Vite path remains a
  consumer-owned one-line Worker entry importing `@edgeproc/browser/worker`.

### Known gaps

- `opfsStore.ts` remains excluded from the numeric jsdom coverage gate because
  jsdom has no OPFS implementation. An in-memory OPFS double covers dual-slot
  promotion, corrupt/zero-byte cleanup, and pre-write handle contention; the
  Chromium tier proves real OPFS persistence.
- The first `0.1.0` publish would carry **no npm provenance**. npm has no
  "pending publisher" state — a trusted publisher attaches to an existing
  package — so the first publish of a new name must be manual, and a published
  version is immutable. If 0.1.0 is bootstrapped this way, the next release must
  be a provenance-bearing patch.

### Evidence

- Gate green: 32 test files, 284 tests. Coverage 92.87% statements / 86.32%
  branches / 96.84% functions / 93.73% lines. The real Chromium SQLite/OPFS
  vector and multi-Worker state persistence tests also pass.
- The `networkSentinel` guard was watched failing, not merely watched passing.
  Four mutations, each verified applied by md5 before its result was trusted and
  each judged on the vitest **exit code** rather than grepped output: dropping the
  `timeOrigin` rebase (3 failures), making `isNetworkSentinelReport` return `true`
  unconditionally (1), accepting entries of any field type (1), and observing
  without `buffered: true` (1). All four went red; the unmutated control was green;
  the file was restored byte-identical.
