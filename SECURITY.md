# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for a security problem.

Report it privately in one of two ways:

1. GitHub's private reporting — go to the
   [Security tab](https://github.com/hseshadr/edgeproc-browser/security/advisories/new)
   and open a draft advisory. This is preferred; it keeps the discussion in the
   repo and lets us issue a CVE if one is warranted.
2. Email `harish.seshadri@gmail.com` with `SECURITY` in the subject.

Please include what you can: the version, a description of the problem, and the
smallest input that reproduces it.

We aim to acknowledge a report within 5 working days and to ship a fix or an
explanation of why it is not a vulnerability within 30 days.

## Supported versions

This project is pre-1.0. Only the latest published version gets fixes. Once 1.0
ships, the latest minor of the current major will be supported as well.

## Threat model

`@edgeproc/browser` deliberately performs network and browser-storage I/O. Its
security boundary is a signed, monotonic pointer: the Worker fetches a pinned
trust root (a public key or a keyring) without HTTP-cache reuse, verifies the
pointer, content-addresses the
manifest, bounds compressed and expanded bytes, verifies every chunk and
reassembled file, then promotes last. Invalid bytes never become a degraded
result.

Important integration rules:

- Pin the expected bundle and channel when the publisher has those identities.
  `undefined` deliberately skips a pin; `null` requires a legacy absent/null
  field exactly.
- Treat the configured public-key URL as a trust root. Serve it over HTTPS and
  control it separately from mutable bundle content.
- Cache names and legacy IndexedDB layouts are local identifiers, not secrets.
  Layout input is bounded and cannot select arbitrary code or callbacks.
- OPFS content and the IndexedDB rollback pointer are untrusted durable state.
  They are revalidated before use; equal-sequence disagreement fails closed.
- The stored active pointer is the anti-rollback floor even when the currently
  pinned key cannot verify it (after a key rotation, or a swapped key), so a key
  change never resets the floor: an older release re-signed by a new key is
  refused as a rollback. The floor only refuses; the cached bundle is served
  offline only under a signature the current trust root verifies. A key
  rotation must therefore keep the publisher's `sequence` increasing.

### Trust root, rotation, revocation, and expiry

- **Trust root forms.** The configured URL serves either exactly 32 bytes (the
  legacy raw Ed25519 key, a keyring of one) or a strict
  `edgeproc.keyring/v1` JSON keyring. The keyring is size-capped (64 KiB)
  before decoding, rejects unknown fields, duplicate ids, malformed hex, and
  any `key_id` that is not the first 16 hex chars of sha256 of its key, and
  must leave at least one key unrevoked. A malformed trust root verifies
  nothing (`KeyringError`). It is fetched `no-store`, same as before; whoever
  controls it controls trust, so host it apart from mutable bundle content.
- **Rotation.** Publish a keyring listing old key A and new key B, then sign
  new pointers with B and a `key_id` naming B at a higher `sequence`. Clients
  keep verifying A-signed caches while A is listed and unrevoked. Extending an
  `expires_at` or switching signer for the same release also needs a new
  `sequence`: the persistent stores refuse to promote a pointer that differs
  from the active one in any signed field at the same sequence.
- **Revocation.** Listing a key id in `revoked` makes every signature by that
  key fail: a pointer naming it fails with `KeyRevokedError`, and a pointer
  without `key_id` is only accepted under unrevoked keys (if it verifies only
  under a revoked key that the ring still lists, it fails with
  `KeyRevokedError`; if the revoked key is no longer listed, with
  `SignatureError`). A cached bundle whose
  pointer was signed by a now-revoked key is refused for offline serving
  (fail closed), yet that pointer remains the anti-rollback floor, so revoking
  a key never lets an older release back in.
- **Unknown signer.** A pointer whose `key_id` is not in the keyring fails
  with `UnknownKeyError`; there is no fallback to other keys.
- **Expiry (freeze/replay defense).** `expires_at` is signed Unix seconds. A
  network-fetched pointer is refused with `PointerExpiredError` once
  `now >= expires_at`, checked after its signature verifies. A publisher using
  expiry must re-sign (with a higher `sequence`) before the deadline, or every
  online client stops updating.
- **Offline-expired policy (deliberate).** When the origin is unreachable,
  sync serves the already-verified cached bundle even if its pointer has
  expired, and marks the result `expired: true`. Refusing would brick offline
  PWAs that hold intact, authentic bytes; the flag lets the application tell
  the user the data may be stale. Applications that must never show expired
  data should treat `expired: true` as a failure.
- **Clock.** Expiry uses the device clock (`Date.now() / 1000`) unless a
  `now()` is injected. A client whose clock runs slow can accept a pointer
  past its deadline; one running fast refuses early. Expiry bounds replay
  windows; it is not a secure time source.
- **Single-verifier callers.** Code that calls `syncIndex` with its own
  `verify` function keeps its behavior. `key_id` is covered by the signature
  but cannot select a key on that path; `expires_at` is still enforced.
### Other integration rules

- Worker error messages can include URLs or producer-controlled identifiers.
  Do not render them as HTML and do not place secrets in bundle paths or URLs.
- The network sentinel is evidence about requests, not an access-control
  mechanism. Same-origin channel messages are shape-checked but are not treated
  as authenticated actors.

Runtime dependencies are `@noble/ed25519`, `@hpcc-js/wasm-zstd`, and
`idb-keyval`. The optional SQLite vector subpath ships pinned local WASM assets
and does not load code from a CDN.
