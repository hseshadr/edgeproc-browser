// @edgeproc/browser — the local-processing substrate of edge-proc, for the tab.
//
// WHAT THIS IS: everything needed to pull a signed, content-addressed bundle
// into a browser and prove it arrived intact — and nothing about what you then
// DO with it. Fetch bytes under a size cap, verify an ed25519 signature over a
// canonical-JSON pointer, bound and verify a zstd decompression, store chunks
// content-addressed in OPFS, reassemble files, and run the whole thing in a
// Worker whose network activity the main thread can actually see.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT: a search engine, a recommender, or a sanctions screener.
// Those are products built ON this substrate and they live in their own repos.
// The rule that keeps this package honest: edge-proc is purely a DEPENDENCY of
// its consumers, so nothing consumer-specific may leak in here. If a module
// needs to know what the bundle CONTAINS, it does not belong in this package.
//
// THE INVARIANT EVERY MODULE SERVES: fail closed. An unverifiable byte is not
// a degraded byte, it is a rejected one. Every path that cannot prove integrity
// throws (SignatureError, IntegrityError, RollbackError, SyncCapError) rather
// than returning something the caller might use.
