# Contributing

Thanks for taking a look. This is a small library and the bar is simple: a
change ships with a test, and `pnpm gate` is green.

## Setup

You need Node >= 22.13 and pnpm. The exact Node version CI uses is 24.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hseshadr/edgeproc-browser.git
cd edgeproc-browser
pnpm install
pnpm gate
```

`pnpm gate` runs lint (biome), typecheck (tsc), the build (tsc), then the tests
with coverage (vitest) — the same command, in the same order, that CI runs. The
build comes *before* the tests on purpose: `files: ["dist"]` means consumers get
only the build output, and `test/dist-contract.test.ts` reads that output off
disk. If the gate passes locally it should pass in CI. If it doesn't, that gap
is a bug worth reporting.

## Making a change

1. Branch off `main`.
2. **Write the failing test first.** Watch it fail for the right reason, then
   make it pass. Bug fixes start with a test that reproduces the bug.
3. Run `pnpm gate`. Coverage thresholds are enforced by `vitest.config.ts`:
   90% lines, 90% statements, 90% functions, 85% branches. They are floors, not
   targets — the measured numbers rounded down, so the gate fails the moment
   coverage slips. Raise them when a change earns it; never lower them. This
   package is a browser boundary, not pure logic, so a few paths genuinely
   cannot be reached under jsdom; `vitest.config.ts` names each exclusion and
   why. `src/engine/opfsStore.ts` is excluded as a **known gap, not as covered
   code** — read the comment there before assuming anything about it.
4. Add a line to `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.
5. Open a pull request describing what changed and why.

`pnpm lint:fix` will fix formatting for you. `pnpm test:watch` is the fast loop.

## Things that will be pushed back on

- **Renaming a shipped export.** Every name in `src/index.ts` — especially the
  error classes consumers catch by identity, like `SignatureError` and
  `RollbackError` — is a public API contract. Deprecate and add; never rename in
  place.
- **Adding a runtime dependency.** There are exactly two (`@noble/ed25519`,
  `@hpcc-js/wasm-zstd`), both doing cryptography or decompression that has no
  business being hand-rolled. A third needs the same justification: make the
  case in the issue before writing the code.
- **Widening the surface without a use case.** New exports need a caller.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with the version you're on, what you passed in, what you got back,
and what you expected. A failing test is the best possible bug report.

For anything security-related, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) — do not open a
public issue.
