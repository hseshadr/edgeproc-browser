// The guard that stands between `npm publish` and unauditable bytes.
//
// `files: ["dist"]` means the tarball IS dist/. The repository now commits a
// deterministic copy for exact-Git clients, but publishing must still rebuild
// from clean source rather than trust whatever happens to be on disk. That is not a
// hypothetical: on 2026-08-08 dist/engine/client.js was rebuilt at 05:58:53,
// three minutes AFTER f3607eb added `#releaseWorker()` and two days after the
// only commit on main. The compiled output carried a fix `main` did not have.
// The publish was stopped by a missing OTP, not by anything in this repo.
//
// So this refuses, before the build runs, on the three ways dist/ can end up
// describing something other than a fetchable commit:
//
//   1. Not a git work tree      — there is no commit to be the source of truth.
//   2. Dirty tree               — source or committed output differs from HEAD.
//   3. HEAD not proven remote   — the commit is neither on a remote-tracking
//                                 branch nor the exact target of a tag on origin.
//
// Then it DELETES dist/, so the `pnpm gate` that follows cannot reuse a stale
// object. tsc's outDir is additive: it overwrites what it re-emits and leaves
// behind whatever it doesn't, so a file deleted from src/ lingers in dist/
// forever unless something removes it. Clean tree + empty dist + a build from
// those sources is what makes "the tarball is a clean build of HEAD" true
// rather than hoped for.
//
// Residual gap, stated rather than papered over: this proves the SOURCES are
// HEAD's, not that the toolchain is. A locally mutated node_modules would still
// change the output. CI's `--frozen-lockfile` install is what closes that, and
// publish.yml re-runs the whole gate from the tagged ref for exactly this reason.
